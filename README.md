## Play around with my app

[My app running on AWS](http://springbootwithreactapp-env.eba-zc8bgb6a.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com)

Feel free to play around with my app using the link above.  
You will be able to perform all CRUD operations:

**C** - **create** a student using the "Add new student+" button at the bottom of the screen  
**R** - **read** all the information about students added to the list  
**U** - **update** a student using blue "Edit" button on the right-hand side in the column "Action"  
**D** - **delete** a student using red "Delete" button on the right-hand side in the column "Action"  

## Local install  

If you would like to play with my app on your local machine, first you need to make sure you have installed:  

1. Java JDK 11+  -> [[download üì•]](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)  
2. Maven  -> [[download üì•]](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
3. Docker  -> [[download üì•]](https://www.docker.com/get-started)  
4. Node.js  -> [[download üì•]](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  
  
When your prerequisite are completed, open your terminal and follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository  

   `git clone https://github.com/Krasy8/SpringBootFullStackAppWithReact.git`  

2. You will need a couple of docker containers (postgres and adminer) running to support the app.  
   Cd into the root folder of the project where you can find the docker-compose.yml file and run  
     
   `docker compose up`  
     
3. Now you can start the app by either running:  
   
   `mvn spring-boot:run`  
   
   or building a .jar file by running:
   
   `mvn install`  
   
   (which should land inside the "**target**" folder and look like this "**fullStackApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar**")  
   
   and executing it by running:   
   
   `java -jar target/fullStackApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`  

4. The backend of the app should be running now on port 8080, all there is left to do is to start the front end on port 3000 by:  
   
   cd inside the "js" folder  
   
   `cd src/js`  
   
   and running:  
   
   `npm start`  
   
5. Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and you should see the UI. You can start adding students!  
   
   Have fun! ü•≥

## Tracking with Snowplow  
  
I have created a separate version of my app where I experimented with Snowplow trackers.  
Please follow the link to a separate branch of this repository called [**'snowplow'**](https://github.com/Krasy8/SpringBootFullStackAppWithReact/tree/snowplow) dedicated to sp trackers implementation.

## Motivation

I have built this demo project to showcase my abilities as a software developer. It combines both: front-end and back-end technologies, as well as, packaging the application and deploying it to Amazon Web Services. This was my first full-stack project which gave me as much head scratches üò§ as satisfaction at the end üòé.
