## Play around with my app

[My app running on AWS](http://springbootwithreactapp-env.eba-zc8bgb6a.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com)

Feel free to play around with my app using the link above.  
You will be able to perform all CRUD operations:

C - **create** a student using the "Add new student+" button at the bottom of the screen  
R - **read** all the information about students added to the list  
U - **update** a student using blue "Edit" button on the right-hand side in the column "Action"  
D - **delete** a student using red "Delete" button on the right-hand side in the column "Action"

## Motivation

I have built this demo project to showcase my abilities as a software developer. It combines both: front-end and back-end technologies, as well as, packaging the application and deploying it to Amazon Web Services. This was my first full-stack project which gave me as much head scratches üò§ as satisfaction at the end üòé.
