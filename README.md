## Motivation ⚡️

I have built this demo project to showcase my abilities as a software developer. It combines both: front-end and back-end technologies, as well as, packaging the application and deploying it to Amazon Web Services. This was my first full-stack project which gave me as much head scratches 😤 as satisfaction at the end 😎.
